# Contributing
First of all, thank you for contributing to FusionCMS! We appreciate all contributions; big and small.

This document serves as a guideline and a list of expectations for contributing to FusionCMS. All of our code is hosted, openly, on GitHub.

## FusionCMS Is Not Open Source
We think open source is great, and have released many open source projects ourselves, but FusionCMS is not open source. **It is source-available software owned by efelle creative.** Ownership by efelle includes contributions made to FusionCMS. We are a group of passionate developers wanting to build the best CMS we can. We've dedicated our craft and our time to building and supporting FusionCMS - It is our livelihood and our baby.

As per our license, we ask a few things of you:

- Do not fork and modify the copyright and CMS to pass off as your own. We will take legal action if we discover instances of this.
- You cannot tamper with or change anything in regards to how we license or enforce licensing within FusionCMS. We currently do not limit functionality (we reserve the right to change this), but do require a paid license if you are using FusionCMS for commercial-use.

FusionCMS is free to use for non-commercial purposes - whether its for your own website, an open source project, a friend or family member, or anything else in-between. We only ask you pay for a license if you are building a website for commercial use, including freelancing. With a professional license you also gain access to contacting us directly through email for support.

Most of us probably haven't heard of the term "source available software". In short, **we think the open source model is fantastic, and don't believe there's reason why there can't be a balance between that and "proprietary" software.** The code for FusionCMS is open and out there. We welcome any and all contributions to the code base by the community. You are free to modify the code for your own needs for your project(s), as long as it does not impede on our license. Just note that we can't provide support for directly modified instances of FusionCMS.

Developing and supporting software is a complex journey. We value the time we ourselves and that of others have put into FusionCMS, and wish to see FusionCMS flourish and grow through the years. We're excited to see what you build and accomplish using FusionCMS, and hope we can share this journey together.

## Code of Conduct
When interacting with us and the community, please adhere to and uphold our Code of Conduct. The tl;dr version is simply this: **Be a nice. We're all human here ✌️**

## Security
If you discover any security related issues, please email security@efelle.com directly instead of using the issue tracker. All reports will be immediately responded to, resolved, and reported to the community.

## Bug Reports
When filing a bug report, your issue should contain a title and a clear description of the issue. You should include as much relevent information as possible and a code sample that illustrates the issue if possible. The goal of a bug report is to make it easy for yourself - and others - to replicate the bug and develop a fix.

Remember, bug reports are created in the hope that others with the same problem will be able to collaborate with you on solving it. Do not expect that the bug report will automatically see any activity or that others will jump to fix it. Creating a bug report serves to help yourself and others start on the path of fixing the problem.

## Pull Requests

### New Features
For new features, please open an issue in the issue tracker to discuss the feature. We'd hate to see you put in a lot of effort into something only for it to be rejected for any reason!

If you propose a new feature or drastic change to any existing functionality, please be willing to implement at least some of the code that would be needed to complete the feature.

Please open one pull request per feature. If you're wanting to add or do multiple things, send multiple pull requests.

### Coding Standards
We follow the PSR-2 coding standard - don't worry if your code isn't perfect in this regard, we will apply automatic styling when merging. Being as close as possible to the standard helps when we manually review your code.

### Tests
Please write tests for any new feature you add. Your code has a higher chance of being accepted if tests are included.

### Documentation
Documentation is currently maintained separately on the official website.

### Branches
Please create a feature branch. We will not accept pull requests from your master branch.
